            Summary: We’ve all grown up with stories about evil dragons,
            hoarding gold and eating young maidens. In the old tales no young
            girl is safe, not even a king’s daughter, when a nation wishes to
            protect itself from the evil dragon.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what if dragons aren’t all evil, greedy and bloodthirsty
            creatures? This is a story about a different sort of dragon.

                <h2>A Dragon's Tale</h2>
                <p>
                  Once upon a time there lived a handsome young prince. One day,
                  when the boy was twenty summers old, his father summoned him
                  into the throne room. “You’ve learned all there is to learn
                  from books, my son. Now it is time for you to go out into this
                  world and prove your valour if you ever wish to be king.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Heavy of heart, the book-loving prince trudged out to the
                  stables to mount his favourite horse. “I guess it’s you and I
                  now, eh boy?”
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                  In a village at the border of the kingdom, a hunter’s daughter
                  named Rochelle made ready to leave. Her father had just been
                  killed on a hunt and now her stepmother meant to have her
                  married off to the mayor of the town, a rich but evil-tempered
                  man. After putting on her father’s old hunting gear, she
                  sneaked out of the window at the back of the house and made
                  her way swiftly and quietly out of the village, across the
                  forest towards the capital.
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                  Meanwhile the prince had reached the countryside outside the
                  capital and was looking for a place to sleep. Knocking on the
                  door of a cabin, he was glad to find the old woman who lived
                  there willing to take him in. She fed him and bade him to
                  sleep in the only bedroom, saying she preferred her rocking
                  chair anyway. Tired as he was, the prince didn’t argue and he
                  soon fell asleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The next morning the prince woke up to find the cabin gone and
                  his hostess, seemingly shrunken, standing in front of him on
                  the dew-covered grass. “I knew you the moment I saw you, Your
                  Highness,” she spat. “Your father killed my son, so I’m taking
                  his.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Please, don’t kill me,” begged the prince, finding to his
                  surprise his voice had become much deeper overnight and smoke
                  came out as he spoke.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Oh I won’t kill you,” cackled the sorceress. “I’ll leave that
                  to your father. The people will be begging him to take action
                  once they see a wild dragon!”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Please, is there no way to break the spell?” pleaded the
                  prince.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Of course, but it’ll never happen. Only if a woman willingly
                  dines with you and sleeps next to you, staying until sunrise,
                  will the spell be broken.”
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                  Ten days later, Rochelle reached the capital only to find it
                  in a state of commotion: the beloved prince had gone missing.
                  Only his horse had returned just as a dragon had appeared near
                  the city. The beast was said to be terrible to look at, with
                  pointy horns along its spine and breathing fire up to ten feet
                  away. Many bounty hunters, big, strong and tough as they were,
                  had taken one look and run for their lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The next morning, after a fine dinner at the inn, a good
                  night’s sleep and a hearty breakfast, Rochelle left the city
                  by the opposite gate and made her way to the mountains,
                  wanting to just get across the border to the neighbouring
                  realm. Destiny had other plans though as her path brought her
                  right up to a cave. It was nearing nightfall and there didn’t
                  seem to be any other shelter in sight; she had no choice but
                  to go in.
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                  “You smell different,” came a deep voice from the shadows.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A chill came over Rochelle as she realised it must be the
                  dragon. “Please don’t eat me,” were the first words out of her
                  mouth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The dragon chuckled: “I won’t eat you if you promise not to
                  kill me.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Deal,” agreed Rochelle quickly. “I have no weapons, only a
                  hunting knife which probably won’t even pierce your scales.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “You hunt?” the dragon’s silver eyes lit up in the gloom. “You
                  haven’t hunted on the way, by any chance?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I’ve got a few rabbits, but there’s no wood for a fire to
                  cook them,” Rochelle spoke, making the dragon laugh again.
                </p>
                <p>“I have fire, don’t you worry.”</p>
                <p>
                  So Rochelle put the rabbits down on the floor of the cave and
                  stood back against the far wall as the dragon breathed his
                  fire on them. In the glow of the fire the silvery horns looked
                  fierce and she recoiled, but once the dark returned she heard
                  the kindness in his voice as he spoke: “Dinner is served, my
                  lady.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  After their meal, Rochelle became sleepy and took her blanket
                  out of her pack, curling up against the cave wall to sleep. It
                  was too cold for comfort though so she soon got up again and
                  moved towards the dragon. “You don’t roll over in your sleep,
                  do you?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The dragon laughed again. “Don’t worry, my lady. I don’t
                  sleep.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  That was enough for Rochelle and she curled up against the
                  dragon’s side for warmth. As she dozed off a thought came to
                  her. “Did you really kill the prince?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “The prince and the dragon can’t exist at the same time,” the
                  dragon answered, and while she was still trying to figure that
                  out, sleep took her.
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                  The next morning as the light of dawn came filtering in,
                  Rochelle woke up. As she padded quietly to the cave’s opening,
                  the dragon watched her go with tears in his eyes, thinking she
                  was leaving. But then she called out: “Come look, it’s
                  beautiful”, and he hurried to her side. The rays of the rising
                  sun hit his scales and suddenly a glow came from within him as
                  well, so bright that she had to look away. As the sun became
                  fully visible over the horizon, she suddenly felt a hand on
                  her shoulder. “Who are you? Where’s the dragon?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I am the dragon,” the prince spoke, back in human form. “You
                  broke the spell.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hesitantly, Rochelle reached out, brushing the hair out of his
                  eyes and finding them to be the same shade of silver as the
                  dragon’s. “It is you!” she laughed and hugged him tight.
                </p>
                <p>Hand in hand, they walked back to the capital.</p>
