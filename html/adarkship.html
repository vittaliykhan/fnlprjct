                <p>
                  The small witch made good use of her elbows to get to the
                  front of the crowd, “Professor Snape! Professor Snape! My name
                  is Rose Bamba, I’d like to ask you a few questions, if I may?”
                  Snape seemed to be staring into the distance, beyond the
                  crowd. "I’m doing a presentation at this year’s International
                  Alchemical Conference in Cairo: Great Potioneers of the Modern
                  Age. It’s a…” Snape’s gaze was broken at the mention of the
                  presentation. He looked around for the source of the voice,
                  tilting his head down he saw a small flustered witch flicking
                  a note pad open. "And what, precisely… do you wish to know?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rose was aware of her heart thumping in her chest, she hadn’t
                  really expected her plan to work. “Well,” she said, “It’s
                  known that as a student at Hogwarts you were able to modify
                  and improve upon the preparations compiled by Libatius Borage
                  for Advanced Potion Making.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Yes…” Snape replied, already sounding bored. His gaze
                  returned to the distance. Rose knew that she better make the
                  most of this chance, while it lasted. “So, when you realised
                  that you could maximise the extraction of juice from
                  sopophorous beans by crushing them with a silver dagger,
                  rather than slicing… I was wondering what would you recommend
                  for an up-and-coming potioneer who has no silver dagger?”
                  Snape slowly turned his head back and looked at Rose’s
                  expectant eyes. “The potioneer... is an artist, Miss Bamba. He
                  chooses his tools… like a painter, chooses his brush." Rose
                  felt her brain galloping, “So you’re saying, that if they are
                  already skilled with their tools, they will instinctively know
                  which to choose for the best result?”
                </p>
                <p>Snape drew a slow breath, “Obviously.”</p>
                <p>
                  Rose began to scribble in her pad, but something had caught
                  Snape’s attention. He turned saying, “Now if you’ll excuse
                  me.” His black robes billowed behind him as he ploughed a
                  furrow through the crowd. “Thank you, Professor!” Rose called
                  after him, but he was already lost in the sea of faces, a dark
                  ship on an unknown course.
