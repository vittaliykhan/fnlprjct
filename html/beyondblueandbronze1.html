                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <h4>The Old Man on the Beach</h4>
                <p>
                  A sheet of sand blew across the empty beach. Empty apart from
                  one hut which yet remained, crooked and cracked. In places,
                  pale blue paint still clung to the weathered woodwork. And on
                  the porch sat a wiry old man. He sat motionless with a walking
                  stick in his hand and a pair of goggles over his eyes, staring
                  straight ahead, looking through the sand as it drifted
                  directly towards him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A group of children tumbled onto the beach, as they tended to
                  do on summers’ mornings. They loved to visit the old
                  storyteller. His tales of adventure, curious creatures and
                  magic, meant that they always came back to visit, even though
                  their parents had told them to, “Leave the old man on the
                  beach alone.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The children, three boys and two girls, argued amongst
                  themselves, all talking over each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Well, it’s your fault you shouldn’t have kicked it over!”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “It’s not my fault that you’re a snail and can’t get to the
                  ball!”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Really? Too scared to climb over into an old lady’s garden?”
                </p>
                <p>“I didn’t see you volunteering.”</p>
                <p>
                  The children all came and sat down on the porch in front of
                  the old man. Without even acknowledging him they carried on,
                  absorbed in their argument.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I think Miss Corvonero is a mean old lady. I bet she has
                  every football that kids have ever kicked over, pressed down
                  on the spikes of her fence.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I’m glad you didn’t climb over. It would be your head on the
                  spike!”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The tallest boy sneered at the shortest one. “She’d probably
                  put you in a jar, Snail. I heard she’s a witch!”
                </p>
                <p>The old man stood up. “A witch?”</p>
                <p>
                  He slowly lifted the goggles on to his forehead, leant forward
                  on his stick and flashed an accusatory glance at each child,
                  who in turn dropped their eyes to the floor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Well of course she’s a witch!” Yelled the old man, waving his
                  stick which just grazed the hair of the tallest child. “And
                  the finest damn witch I ever met too.” A wrinkled smile broke
                  on the old man’s face as he sat back down into his wicker
                  chair. A girl lifted her head, “Did you know her, Sir?” Then
                  the other added, “Was she very terrible?” He laughed at their
                  questions and waved for them to come closer. “I suppose it is
                  time for a story… Come on then.” The children sat on the sandy
                  porch in a semi-circle around their bony story teller, who
                  adjusted his goggles and began.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “We first met when we were 11 years old, in Diagon Alley. The
                  sights, smells and tastes of wizarding shops never leave you
                  from the first time you set foot on the cobbles, and of
                  course, the moment that your wand chooses you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the girls put her hand up, but the old man had a
                  distant look in his eyes and continued, “From the day my
                  acceptance letter arrived, the only thing that excited me more
                  than the prospect of actually attending Hogwarts School of
                  Witchcraft and Wizardry, was the thought of visiting the
                  world’s greatest wand-maker, Ollivander. I told myself… This
                  is where everything truly begins!”
                </p>
