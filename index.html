        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Vitaliy but everyone calls me Vit.</p>
        <p>
          One of my passions is reading books and I would like to meet more
          people with the same interest!
        </p>
        <p>I truly believe that reading could help humanity to become better</p>

      <article class="middle col-md-8 bg-middle table-cell">
        <h2>Hello and Welcome to Vit's Book Club!</h2>
        <p>
          Just a quick intro: I'm Vit. I was born in Almaty, Kazakhstan. I am
          interested in books and stories that they can tell.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/pictures/wingsreadinghufflepuff.jpg"

        <p>
          I find reading and creative activities to be a true sanctuary for me,
          especially when life becomes overwhelming. As someone diagnosed with
          Autism Spectrum Disorder, my heightened sensory sensitivity often
          leads to sensory overload. However, engaging in these activities
          allows me to escape and find respite from the sensory challenges I
          face.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's wonderful to hear that fantasy books, particularly the Harry
          Potter series, provide you with a favorite escape. J.K. Rowling's
          magical world has captured the hearts of millions of readers around
          the globe. Being sorted into Hufflepuff on Pottermore means that you
          possess qualities such as loyalty, dedication, and a strong sense of
          fairness. Hufflepuffs are known for their inclusive nature and their
          ability to value and appreciate others. Embracing your Hufflepuff
          identity can be a source of pride and a way to connect with fellow
          fans of the series.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to finding solace and getting lost in a story, "chick
          lit" fiction is a genre I often turn to. There's something delightful
          about immersing myself in the lives of relatable female protagonists
          as they navigate love, career, friendships, and personal growth. On
          sunny afternoons, when I have the luxury of lounging in the garden,
          these light-hearted and entertaining books make for the perfect easy
          reads. They offer a charming escape into a world that feels both
          familiar and enchanting, allowing me to unwind and enjoy the sunshine
          while getting lost in a captivating narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then there are times when you really want some fresh new story,
          something you haven't read yet, something short (or not quite so
          short) for a change. Those are the times for discovering unpublished
          stories, fan fiction and similar. I've got a few of those for your
          delectation on this site too. I have found them from different artists
          and I believe they are worth reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Settle in and make yourself comfortable while you embark on your
          reading journey. Happy reading and may your literary adventures be
          filled with joy and relaxation!
